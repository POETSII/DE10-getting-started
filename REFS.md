# Reference Material

Pointers to documentation with comments on the quality and applicability of the material.

## Stratix 10 SX General Documentation

* [Intel Stratix 10 SX SoC Development Kit User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/documentation/sbe1494623766556.html)
  User guide for Intel's development kit, which has some differences to the DE10Pro board but is still helpful.

## Partial Reconfiguration

* [AN 825: Partially Reconfiguring a Design: on Intel Stratix 10 GX FPGA Development Board](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/documentation/pgn1503942847017.html)
  A clear guide to partitioning a design ready for partial reconfiguration but focused on GX devices not SX devices that we have.

* [Arria 10 SoC Hardware Reference Design That Demonstrates Partial Reconfiguration](https://rocketboards.org/foswiki/Projects/Arria10SoCHardwareReferenceDesignThatDemostratesPartialReconfiguration)
  Example for Arria 10 SoC FPGAs that has many similarities with Stratix 10.


## Reconfiguration from the HPS (ARM) side

* [Stratix 10 SoC - Configuring FPGA from HPS Design Example](https://rocketboards.org/foswiki/Projects/Stratix10SoCConfiguringFPGAfromHPSDesignExample)
  An example from RocketBoards 20 Jan 2021, which is somewhat helpful.
